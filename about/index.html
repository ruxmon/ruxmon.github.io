<h2>ABOUT RUXMON</h2>
<p>Established in April 2010, Ruxmon is a free monthly community event organised and run by the Ruxcon team. We currently have monthly meetings running in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane. </p>
<p>Each month two speakers from the local security community will share their knowledge on a security topic ranging  from introductory/beginner level to more advanced topics. Presentations are followed up with a catchup at a local pub. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend, especially newcomers.</p>
<p>If you're interested in IT Security and related topics, looking to learn a bit more, or want to meet up with fellow security people, then you should definitely check out a meeting.</p>
<p>Ruxmon is a true grass-roots event. There are no sales pitches, no membership fees, and it is not a thinly veiled attempt to promote the services or personalities of an affiliated company. Weâ€™re just about good content, drinks, and discussion.</p>
<h2>Submit a talk</h2>
<p>Ruxmon relies on people from the community to volunteer presentations and we are always looking for new speakers! Please do not hesitate to get in contact with us about a potential presentation, even if you think the topic might not fit. </p>
<p>Presentations are intended to be short (10-40 minutes) and informal. Any topic is welcome, a presentation could be as simple as speaking for 10 minutes about a project you are currently working on, or day to day work tasks within your given field. A projector and screen will be provided, speakers are encouraged to bring their own laptop.  </p>
<p>If you would like to submit a talk please email: <strong>ruxmon@ruxcon.org.au</strong>.</p>
